p prime number where 2L 1 < p < 2L
 for 512 L 1024 and L a multiple of 64; i.e., bit
length of between 512 and 1024 bits in increments of 64 bits

q prime divisor of (p 1), where 2159 < q < 2160; i.e., bit length of 160 bits
g = h(p 1)/q
 mod p, where h is any integer with 1 < h < (p 1) such that h(p 1)/q
 mod p > 1
User's Private Key
x random or pseudorandom integer with 0 < x < q
User's Public Key
y = gx mod p
User's Per-Message Secret Number
k = random or pseudorandom integer with 0 < k < q
Signing
r = (gk mod p) mod q
s = [k-1 (H(M) + xr)] mod q
Signature = (r, s)
Verifying
w = (s')-1 mod q
u1 = [H(M')w] mod q
u2 =(r')w mod q
v = [(gu 1 yu 2) mod p] mod q
TEST: v = r'
M = message to be signed
H(M) = hash of M using SHA-1
M', r', s' = received versions of M, r, s
