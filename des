We have mentioned that DES uses a 56-bit key. Actually, the initial key consists of 64 bits. However, before the DES process even starts, every 8th bit of the key is discarded to produce a 56-bit key. That is bit positions 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64 are discarded. 
Thus, the discarding of every 8th bit of the key produces a 56-bit key from the original 64-bit key.
DES is based on the two fundamental attributes of cryptography: substitution (also called confusion) and transposition (also called diffusion). DES consists of 16 steps, each of which is called a round. Each round performs the steps of substitution and transposition. Let us now discuss the broad-level steps in DES. 

In the first step, the 64-bit plain text block is handed over to an initial Permutation (IP) function.
The initial permutation is performed on plain text.
Next, the initial permutation (IP) produces two halves of the permuted block; says Left Plain Text (LPT) and Right Plain Text (RPT).
Now each LPT and RPT go through 16 rounds of the encryption process.
In the end, LPT and RPT are rejoined and a Final Permutation (FP) is performed on the combined block
The result of this process produces 64-bit ciphertext.
